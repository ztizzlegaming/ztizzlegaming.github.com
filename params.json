My favorite languages are Java, PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Objective-C. Of course there are more languages that I like, but I find myself programming in these the most.\r\n\r\nMy main project at the moment is a website called [H2O Worldwide](http://www.h2oworldwide.org). You can read more about it and view the source code [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/h2o-worldwide)!\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s about it, you should head on over to my GitHub page to see everything I am working on!\r\n\r\n~ Jordan","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
